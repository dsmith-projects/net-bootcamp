This project is about a restaurant application that lets your order one or more 'casados'. A 'casado' is the typical Costa Rican dish served at lunch.

This project uses the DECORATOR pattern as well as a simple LinkedList algorithm.

I based this project on an example preseted at the video C# Design Patterns at Lynda.com. The core structure is copy of the decorator pattern presented at the example. Eveything else was invented by me.
